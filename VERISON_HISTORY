ARCPAT01:
* Initial version

ARCPAT02:
* Added this VERSION_HISTORY file to track major differences between versions.
* "NEW" and "PATCH" commands have been been modified to include a new uint32
  compression engine ID that describes which compression engine, if any, has
  been used to compress the payload. For "NEW" commands, this is the ID of the
  compression engine used to compress the entire content of the new entry. For
  "PATCH" commands, this is the ID of the compression engine used to compress
  the delta. 0 means no compression, 1 means DEFLATE. These compression engines
  are not necessarily related to those supported by the ZIP specification, as
  they are only used for patching and not as part of the resulting output
  archive.
