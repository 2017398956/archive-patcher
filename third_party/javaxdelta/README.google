Description:
A library for building and applying patches to binary files.

In the context of archive-patcher, this library provides one possible
implementation of a delta algorithm that can be applied per-resource.

Local Modifications:
LICENSE.TXT renamed to LICENSE and moved to this directory.
Moved src/main/java/com/ to just src/com/
Deleted **/package-info.java
Deleted all other files and directories, as they are unnecessary in this
implementation. Note that this means the initial checkin does not compile.

Modified the following two files to use java.util.HashMap<Long, Integer> instead
of the Trove-based LongIntHashMap, eliminating the dependency upon Trove:
src/com/nothome/delta/Checksum.java
src/com/nothome/delta/text/Checksum.java
