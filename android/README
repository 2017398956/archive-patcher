This directory contains independent Android applications that access their
archive-patcher dependencies via a local file repository. Build that repository
in the parent directory by executing "gradle uploadArchives", which will
"upload" the JARs to "../local-build-repo". Use this path as input to a
"flatDir" gradle repository to access all the built artifacts.
