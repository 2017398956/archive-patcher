In this directory you can place extra libraries ("ext-lib") needed to compile
the source code in the extra source ("../ext-src") directory.

To add support for JxdDeltaGenerator and JxdDeltaApplier, you need to add the
following libraries here:

* javaxdelta-2.0.1.jar
  Source: http://sourceforge.net/projects/javaxdelta/

* trove-2.1.0.jar
  Source: https://bitbucket.org/robeden/trove/
  IMPORTANT: You must use 2.1.0; package names have changed in the 3.x branch
  and javaxdelta will not resolve them properly at runtime if you use a 3.x JAR.
